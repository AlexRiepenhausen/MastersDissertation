Extracting Structured Information From Legal Documents

**Acknowledgments**

The LSTM classifier was built using [emadRad's implementation](https://github.com/emadRad/lstm-gru-pytorch/blob/master/lstm_gru.ipynb), a fellow user of GitHub

Likewise, the Word2Vec trainer uses [Andras7's implementation](https://github.com/Andras7/word2vec-pytorch)

My own model ties these two implementations together with the end goal being the successful classification of legal documents according to their ownership patterns, which is the topic of my Master's dissertation
